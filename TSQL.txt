
T/SQL = Transact SQL

>> T/SQL Stands for "Transact Structure Query Language".It is an extension of SQL Language.This is 
   same as PL/SQL in Oracle.

>> In SQL we can execute single line of statement only where in T/SQL we can execute block of 
   statements at a time.

>> SQL does not support conditional and looping statement  like if-else and while,for loops.But we 
   can implement these conditional and looping statements in T/SQL.

>> SQL Language will not provide reusability facilities where as T/SQL language will provide 
   reusability by defining objects such as Procedures and functions.

>> T/SQL commands can be embedded inside the programs where program is a block of code.

# T/SQL program blocks can be divided into two types.
	1. Anonymous blocks : anonymous blocks are called as unnamed block of code which is executed
		at  any point of time and does not store on database.These blocks can be written on 
		Query window and execute.

	2. Sub-program blocks : Sub program blocks are called as Named block of code which is executed
		at any point of time and stored on database.These blocks are providing resuability of 
		code.


# Declaring Variables In T/SQL Program
Syntax : Declare @variableName datatype[Size]...

ex : declare @empId int;
     declare @ename varchar(20);	

Note  : While declaring variable,we should  be prefixed with @ symbol. 

# Assigning values of Variables : Values can be assigned by using a 'SET' statement

Syntax : Set @VariableName = value

ex : Set @empId = 101;
     Set @ename = 'Amit';	

# Printing Values of Variables : If we want to print the values we can use the 'PRINT' statement
Syntax : Print @VariableName

ex : Print @empId;

# Structure of T/SQl Program

Syntax : 
	Declare @variableName datatype[Size]...

	Set @VariableName = value

	Statements ;

	Print @VariableName


Ex1 : Write a T/SQL Program to input two values and interchange the variable values

	declare @a int,@b int,@c int; 
	
	set @a = 10;
	set @b = 20;
	
	Print @a;
	Print @b;

Ex2 :  Write a  T/SQl program to input student id ,name,marks and find the total marks of student

declare @id int,@name varchar(30),@m1 int,@m2 int,@m3 int,@total int;
Set @id= 101;
Set @name = 'Amit';
Set @m1 = 75;
Set @m2 = 86;
Set @m3 = 91;
Set @total = @m1 + @m2 + @m3;
Print @id;
Print @name;
Print @total;


Ex 3 : Write a T/SQL Program to perform arithematic opertion.

declare @num1 int,@num2 int,@result int;
set @num1 = 20;
set @num2 = 10;

Set @result = @num1 + @num2;
print @result


Conditional Statements : It is a block of code ,which executes based on a condition.

# If-else Statement : In If-else conditional control statement,If block gets executes only
 when condition is true and statements in else block get executes only when the condition is false

Synatx : 
	if(condition)
	{
	 Statements
	}
	else
	{
	Statements
	}


Ex 4 : Write a T/SQL Program to find big number from two variables
 declare @a int,@b int;
 set @a = 30;
 set @b = 20;
 if(@a>@b)
 {
 Print 'A is big'
 }
 else 
 {
 Print 'B is big'
 }

 Ex 5 : To find +ve and -ve Number

 declare @a int;
 Set @a = 10;
 if(@a>0)
 Print 'A is +ve Number'
 if(@a = 0)
  Print 'A is neutral Number'
 else
 Print 'A is -ve Number'

Ex 6 : Write a T/SQL program to find number is even or odd


Case Function :  The case function if we want to use multiple conditional statements in program and 
execute only the true condition block or what we input that result

Syntax : 

Selcet case @VariableName

when caseValue then 'display value'

when caseValue then 'display value'

when caseValue then 'display value'

end

ex 7 :
 declare @weekdays int
 Set @weekdays = 7
 Select Case @weekdays
 when 1 Then 'Sunday'
 when 2 Then 'Monday'
 when 3 Then 'Tuesday'
 when 4 Then 'Wednesday'
 when 5 Then 'Thursday'
 when 6 Then 'Friday'
 when 7 Then 'Saturday'
 end

OR

Syntax : 

Selcet case 

when @VariableName=caseValue then 'display value'

when @VariableName=caseValue then 'display value'

when @VariableName=caseValue then 'display value'

end


# While Loop : Sets a condition for repeated execution of an SQL Statement or  statement block.The
statement block are executed repeatedly as long as the specified condition is true.The execution of 
statements in while loop can be controlled from outside the loop with BREAK and CONTINUE keys.

Syntax : 
 WHILE Boolean expression
 [BIGIN]
	<SQl statement / block >
	[BREAK]
	<SQl statement / block >
	[CONTINUE]
	<SQl statement / block >
 [END]


BREAK  : It Causes an exit from the inner most while loop.Any statements that appear after End Keyword,
marking the end loop,are executed

CONTINUE : It Causes  the While loop ton restart,ignoring any statements after the CONTINUE keyword


Ex 8 : Write a T/SQL program to print value fron 1-10 using while loop
	declare @x int
	set @x = 0

	While @x<10
	BEGIN
		Set @x = @x+1
		Print @x
	End


Ex 9 : Write a T/SQL program to print value fron 1-10 and stop the loop when value reaches to 6 using while
 loop
	declare @x int
	set @x = 0

	While @x<10
	BEGIN
		Set @x = @x+1
		Print @x
	End

Ex 10 : Write a T/SQL program which takes the empno and increments the salary of employee on following criteria
	1. If job is President increment with 10%
	2. If job is Manager increment with 8%
	3. If job is Analyst increment with 6%
	4. If job is any thing other increment with 5%

declare @empno int,@job varchar(50)
Set @empno = 7839

select @job = job  from emp where empno=@empno

If @job = 'President'
	Update emp set sal = sal + sal * 0.1 where empno = @empno

Else If @job = 'Manager'
	Update emp set sal = sal + sal * 0.08 where empno = @empno

Else If @job = 'Analyst '
	Update emp set sal = sal + sal * 0.06 where empno = @empno

Else
	Update emp set sal = sal + sal * 0.05 where empno = @empno



SUB-Programs : A sub program is a named block of code that is directly saved on server and it can be executed 
	when and where ir is requied.We have two types of sub-programs in SQL Server

	1. Stored Procedures / Procedure
	2. Stored Functions/Functions


1. Stored Procedures / Procedure : A Stored Procedure is a database object which contains precompiled queries.
	Stored procedures are a block of code designed to perform a task whenever we called.

Why we need Stored Procedure : Whenever we want to execute a SQL query from an application the SQL query will 
	first parsed(i.e. Compiled) for execution where the process of parsing is time consuming bcoz parsing
	occurs each and every time we execute the query or statement.
	
	To overcome the above problem we write SQL statements or queries under stored procedure and execute
	bcoz a stored proc edure is pre compiled block of code without parsing the statements gets executed 
	whenever the procedures are called which can increase the performance of an application. 


# How to create Stored Procedures/Procedure (Without parameter)
Syntax : 
	create Procedure ProceduresName
	As
	Begin
		<Statements>
	End

	Note :  Once the procedure is created it is physically saved on the server as a database Object which
	can be called whenever we required to the user

	We can call the above procedure from anywhere and from any application that is developed 
	using JAVA or .Net language


# How to call a Stored Procedures/Procedure

Syntax : exec ProcedureName


Ex 11. Examples on without parameters Procedures : 

1. Write a simple procedure program (without parameters) to print WELCOME statement on the query window

 
 create Procedure Test1
 As
 Begin
	print 'Welcome to stored Procedure'
 End

----------------------------------------
	How to execute

	exec Test1

	O/p : Welcome to stored Procedure

# Passing Parameters to Procedures : If we want to pass parameters to procedure then we are using the below
syntax

Syntax : Create procedures ProcedureName
	
	 (Passing parameters)

	 As

	 Begin

	    <Statements>
    	End
	

Ex 12. Examples on parameters Procedures : 

Write a program  to add the two values with parameters Procedure


Create procedure addTwo(@a int,@b int)
as
begin
declare @c int
Set @c = @a + @b;
Print 'Addition ='+cast(@c as varchar);
end


----------------------------------------
	How to execute

	exec addTwo 2,3

	O/p : Addition = 5


Ex 13. Create a procedure to display employee details of employee from emp table

create procedure empSearch
as
begin
select * from Emp
end


Ex 14. Create a procedure to accept employee id and delete the record from emp table

create procedure empDel(@eid int)
as
begin
delete from emp where empno = @eid
end 


Ex 15:  Writr a program to perform arithmetic opertions of two values with parameters procedure
